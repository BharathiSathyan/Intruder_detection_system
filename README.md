# Intruder_detection_system
FEATURES
The system captures an image of the intruder using the computer's camera and sends it to
the user's mobile device using the Pushbullet service. This allows the user to visually
identify the intruder and take appropriate actions. Additionally, an alert message is
displayed on the computer screen to notify the user of the suspected intrusion. If the user
confirms the presence of an intruder, they can choose to log off the system immediately to
prevent any unauthorized access or data breach.
